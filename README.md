ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eumin Zoh

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DATA WORLD!!

As data have the potential to make a better world, I am curious about exploring data in depth and creating insights from them. 
I am a highly motivated data analyst with problem-solving and communication skills. 
My goal is to not only help companies solve strategic problems but also create social values using data.

My skillset includes:
- Languages: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL (MySQL), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret), MATLAB 
- Software: RStudio, Jupyter, MySQL, Tableau, Adobe Analytics, Excel, PowerPoint
